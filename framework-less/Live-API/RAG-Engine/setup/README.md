# Vertex AI - RAG Engine & Gemini Live API integration

## Getting Started

Start by creating an isolated python virtual environment.
> for example, with venv and a virtual environment named 'venv', `python -m venv venv`

Install the required packages from requirements.txt.
> for example, with pip, `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the step-by-step notebook example - rag_engine_vvs.ipynb

Replace project and location variables to match your environment. Replace any other variables as you see fit. Once you have executed all cells in the notebook, you should be able to proceed with building out the projects in the 'text2text' and 'audio2audio' folders.
